#  Nodal Rate Limit Middleware

This is a middleware package for [Nodal](http://www.nodaljs.com) that performs basic rate-limiting on public endpoints. This is intentionally a very simplistic piece of middleware that does not share any state.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save nodal-middleware-ratelimit
```
